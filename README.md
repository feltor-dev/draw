<h3> Welcome to the DRAW project </h3>

The DRAW library helps
to realize a 2D visualisation from within a running simulation. It is licensed under the MIT license and has been developed by Matthias Wiesenberger and Markus Held.

<h4> Library dependencies </h4>

- the DRAW library relies on a working installation of OpenGL and [glfw-3](http://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- the device_window needs [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (and thrust which is included),

<h4> Library documentation </h4>
The library comes with a documentation that can be
created using [Doxygen]( http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ ) via:
    doxygen Doxyfile
that will create a doc/ subdirectory.
Open with
    firefox doc/html/index.html
